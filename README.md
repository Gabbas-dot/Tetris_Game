# Tetris Game (C++)

A clean and well-structured **Tetris-style game** developed in **C++** using the **raylib** graphics library.  
This project demonstrates object-oriented programming, clear code organization, and fundamental game development concepts.

---

## Overview
This project recreates the core mechanics of the classic Tetris game while focusing on readable, modular, and maintainable C++ code.  
It was developed as a learning-focused portfolio project suitable for internship evaluation.

## Features
- Classic Tetris gameplay
- Falling, moving, and rotating blocks
- Grid-based collision detection
- Line clearing logic
- Score tracking
- Consistent game loop and state management

---

## Technologies Used
- **C++**
- **raylib** (graphics, window, and input handling)

---

## Project Structure
- `main.cpp` — Program entry point and main game loop  
- `game.cpp / game.h` — Core game logic and state management  
- `grid.cpp / grid.h` — Grid handling and line clearing logic  
- `block.cpp / block.h` — Tetris block shapes and rotation logic  
- `position.cpp / position.h` — Position and movement handling  
- `colors.cpp / colors.h` — Centralized color definitions
